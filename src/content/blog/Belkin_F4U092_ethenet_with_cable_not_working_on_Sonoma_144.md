`USB 10... LAN` was suddenly unfunctional, and I tried to plug in/out multiple times, the USB function working well, but the ethernet port, which has a shiny LED looked to work, but the service in MAC, doesn't, it is grey, and unusable.

after a few months until now, tried to set `allow accessories to connect` with `ask every time`[^1], it work
